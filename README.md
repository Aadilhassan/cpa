# CPA

**CPA** (Cost Per Action Platform) is a web-based rewards and earnings platform where users can earn money by completing simple tasks such as downloading apps or sharing referral links. The platform also supports a referral system, enabling users to earn additional rewards when their invited friends participate.


## ⚠️ This is a very old project
